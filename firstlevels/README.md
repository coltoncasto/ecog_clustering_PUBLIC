Contained in this subdirectory are the two main scripts used to run identify language-responsive electrodes ('firstlevels'). They are intended to take as input a preprocessed *object* that is saved after preprocessing (see `../preprocessing`). Although these preprocessed objects are not availible publicly, we have provided the code used to identify language-responsive electrodes for transparency. For those interested in tracing the code, a sample command to identify these electrodes has been provided below.

```matlab
analyze_MITLangloc('fromScratch',true,...
                   'plotLangResponsive',true,...
                   'doOneSub','AMC026',...
                   'experiment','MITSWJNTask');
```
